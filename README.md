  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;

### Things to Focus On üõ†Ô∏è

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that your component is responsive and displays correctly across different devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

- **Functionality**: Implement any necessary interactivity or functionality according to the design specifications. This might include animations, or any other interactive elements (we are expecting these since the component is a slider/carousel).

- **Technologies**: We are giving you the tools and frameworks to build the component. For the carousel you will use `slick` which is already included in the `HTML` file, so no need to add the dependency, is already there.

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, human-readable, and maintainable code. Follow best practices for HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. Use appropriate naming conventions and comments where necessary.
