# How to run this project ðŸ’»

Since this is a simple HTML/CSS/JS project, you can run it using the [Live Server VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and see it in action! 
To modify the SCSS file and see it in action, use the following command lines:

```
  npm install -g sass
  sass -w ./css/index.scss ./css/index.css
```
