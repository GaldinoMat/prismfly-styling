# Prismfly ‚Äì Front End Developer Coding Test üíª

## Introduction üí°

Welcome to the Front End Developer Challenge! This challenge is designed to assess your skills and creativity in front end web development. You'll be working on a project that involves building a responsive/flexible web page component based on given design specifications.

## Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

- Design Specifications: You will be provided with design mockups from a Figma file. Your task is to translate this design into a fully functional web page component using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

- Responsive Design: Ensure that your component is responsive and displays correctly across different devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

- Functionality: Implement any necessary interactivity or functionality according to the design specifications. This might include animations, or any other interactive elements (we are expecting these since the component is a slider/carousel).

- Technologies: We are giving you the tools and frameworks to build the component. For the carousel you will use `slick` which is already included in the `HTML` file, so no need to add the dependency, is already there.

- Code Quality: Write clean, human-readable, and maintainable code. Follow best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use appropriate naming conventions and comments where necessary.

- Submission: Once you have completed the challenge, upload your code to a GitHub repository and provide the link, so make sure you set your repo to public.

## Design Mockup üé®

You will find the design mockups for this challenge in the attached Figma file. The mockups include designs for desktop and mobile views. You are expected to replicate this design as pixel perfect as possible.

## Timeframe ‚è±Ô∏è

Based on internal team performance if you are spending more than `4 hours` to complete this challenge you might not be the right fit for us, however if you spend an extra `hour` but you have a pixel perfect and clean code solution of course we encourage you to submit your test. Please prioritize quality over speed, but make sure to submit your completed project within the given timeframe with a total hour report spent on the challenge.

## Evaluation Criteria üìù

- Accuracy in replicating the design specifications
- Responsiveness and compatibility across different devices
- Functionality and interactivity
- Code quality and organization

## Additional Notes üóíÔ∏è
